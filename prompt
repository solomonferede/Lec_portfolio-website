You are an expert academic web editor.

I already have an existing personal academic website.
Your task is NOT to create a new website from scratch, but to UPDATE, REFINE, and EXTEND the current website content.

CRITICAL RULE:
For every section, component, or menu item:

If it already exists → update and refine it

If it does not exist → create it using the same structure and style as the existing website

AUTHORITATIVE PROFILE SOURCE

Use the attached @profile.pdf file as the single source of truth for my background, education, experience, skills, and achievements.

INSTRUCTIONS

Extract and align all information strictly from profile.pdf.

Do NOT invent, assume, or exaggerate any qualifications, publications, or roles.

Update existing website sections to accurately reflect the PDF data.

Create missing sections only when necessary, based on the section list below.

Improve clarity, academic tone, and international readability.

Ensure full consistency across all sections (titles, dates, roles, terminology, skills).
